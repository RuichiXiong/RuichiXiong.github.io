<p style="text-align: justify">I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Economic Analysis and Policy Area of Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. My current researches focus on the importance of international geographic and social connections in facilitating information flow between individuals and firms in different countries.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">My job market paper studies the effects of interregional accessibility to <ins>non-local</ins> suppliers on firm creation with both theory and empirics. With a novel instrument, I show that reduced travel time to China in recent decades facilitates firm creation in US cities by increasing entrepreneurs' accessibility to potential suppliers in China. Estimating a quantitative spatial model illuminates that heterogeneity in supplier presence across Chinese cities accounts for about a half of the aggregate impact because of the assortive matching between time reductions and supplier presence on flight network.</p>

Research interests: Urban, Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Trade, Development.

I am on the 2022/2023 job market.
