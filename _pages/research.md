"**Interregional Accessibility and Firm Creation in the Fragmented Economy**", *Job Market Paper* 

[<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/jmp.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]

<font size="-1">
<p style="text-align: justify"> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Does the reduction in international travel time lower the entry cost for firms, especially those accessing non-local suppliers in the globally fragmented economy? I study this question in the context of recent US-China aviation network expansions, documenting sharp and unevenly distributed travel time reductions between US cities and Chinese prefectures. Employing a novel instrument for travel time constructed from the gradual deregulation of the US-China flight market, I show that the reduction in travel time to China promotes the creation of firms in US cities, more in industries that use many different suppliers. To account for the heterogeneity in supplier presence within China, I estimate a quantitative spatial model featuring sourcing location choice, input-output structure, and a firm entry decision. The model illuminates that the 2004-2013 US-China aviation network expansion increases US firm creation by 1.7%. The heterogeneity in supplier presence across Chinese prefectures drives 42% of the increase because of assortative matching between supplier presence and time reductions in the sparse US-China flight network.</p></font>

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: As a developing country, China became the top destination for foreign direct investment in just a few decades, defying the "Lucas paradox." Using a unique administrative dataset of the universe foreign firms in China, this paper documents that initial foreign direct investment was mainly driven by the Chinese diaspora; massive non-diaspora foreign direct investment did not materialize until a later stage. Leveraging the staggered opening up of Chinese prefectures during 1981-96 as an identification strategy, the paper finds that following the opening up, diaspora direct investment is more likely to enter prefectures with stronger lineage connections. These prefectures also witness a greater number of non-diaspora foreign and domestic private entrants in the later period.</p></font>

"**Endogenous Learning, Dynamic Agglomeration, and the Skill Premium over Life Cycle**"

[*Preliminary Draft Available Upon Request*]

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper proposes a new measure of learning with time use survey data. I show that learning time is lower in big city and higher for high skill workers, especially when they are young. This finding indicates that there is a endogenous learning-working tradeoff with skill-learning complementarity. This paper also documents that in 1980-2007 US census data, city size wage elasticity first diverges and then converges over worker’s life cycle. This fact cannot be explained by existed literature which considers only passive experience accumulation as learning. The theoretical part of this paper therefore introduces the empirically observed endogenous learning-working tradeoff into a dynamic life cycle model nesting the experience accumulation. The model shows that both the divergence and convergence can be accounted for under one unified framework. Furthermore, the model can also match several other novel facts presented in this paper, including the skill-youngness complementarity in learning time, the declining skill premium gap between big and small cities over life cycle, and the declining sorting of high skilled workers into big cities over life cycle.</p></font>
