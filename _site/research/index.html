<p>“Interregional Accessibility and Firm Creation in the Fragmented Economy”, Job Market Paper</p>

<font size="+1">
<div style="text-align: justify"> Abstract: What are the effects of interregional accessibility on firm creation? I study this phenomenon in the context of international air connections between the USA and China. I provide a new measure of travel time between US CBSAs and Chinese prefectures over years and document its sharp and unevenly distributed reductions. With a novel instrument for travel time constructed from the gradual deregulation of US-China flight market, I show that the reductions on travel time to China increase firm creation in US cities. The effects of travel time reductions are larger in industries requiring many different suppliers. This motivates a quantitative spatial model with sourcing location choice, input-output structure, and firm entry decision. Estimating the model illuminates that, the 2004-2013 US-China aviation network expansion improves firm creation by 1.7% and welfare by 0.4% where 42% of the firm creation increases and 50% of the welfare gains are driven by the supplier presence across Chinese prefectures, because time reductions are larger in Chinese prefectures with higher presence of suppliers. In a counterfactual in which the flight network is expanded homogeneously by connecting all international gateway airports in US and China, the heterogeneity in supplier presence across Chinese prefectures accounts for only 1% of the aggregate effects.</div></font>

<p>“Familiar Strangers: Lineage Connection and Diaspora Direct Investment in China”, with Fanghao Chen and <a href="https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&amp;wbtreeid=1099&amp;user_id=x.zhang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xiaobo Zhang</a></p>

<font size="+1"> 
<div style="text-align: justify">Abstract: This paper studies the importance of international lineage network in facilitating the entry of foreign firms into developing country where immature market environment deters foreign investment. We build a unique dataset on the universe of foreign firms in China that are controlled by Chinese diasporas whose surnames are used to infer their lineage groups. A novel triple-difference design exploiting variations from both the staggered opening of prefectures during the Reform Era (1981-1996) and their differential surname distributions is implemented for identification. We find that, following the prefecture-level opening shocks, the entry of diaspora firms with higher connection increase more, because lineage network facilitates information sharing and contract enforcement. On the contrary, there are no such effects following China's accession to WTO because market institutions had been improved much after the Reform Era. We also find that the lineage-driven diaspora firm entrants during early development stages functioned as industrial seeds, in the form of generating large and long-term positive spillovers on non-diaspora firm entry and investment.</div></font>

<p>“Endogenous Learning, Dynamic Agglomeration, and Skill Premium over Life Cycle”</p>

<font size="+1"> 
<div style="text-align: justify">Abstract: This paper proposes a new measure on learning with time use survey data and shows that learning time is lower in big city and higher for high skill workers especially when they are young. This indicates endogenous learning-working tradeoff with skill complementarity. This paper also documents the fact that in 1980-2007 US census data city size wage elasticity firstly diverge and then converge over worker's life cycle. And the fact cannot be explained by existed literature which only considered passive experience accumulation as learning. Therefore the theoretical part of this paper introduces the empirically observed endogenous learning-working tradeoff into dynamic life cycle model nesting experience accumulation and shows that both the divergence and convergence can be accounted for under one unified framework. Furthermore, the model can also match several other novel facts presented in this paper including skill-youngness complementarity in learning time, declining skill premium gap between big and small cities over life cycle, and declining sorting of high skill workers into big city over life cycle.</div></font>

<p>“Does the College Graduate Village Officials Program Improve Village Governance in China?”</p>

<font size="+1">
<div style="text-align: justify">Abstratct: This paper estimates the effects of sending officials from upper-level governments to rural villages on unpopular policies' implementation by evaluating the College Graduate Village Officials (CGVO) program's impacts on land expropriation and one child policy. I find that introducing CGVOs into villages does not improve the implementation of unpopular policies significantly. Then I propose a model to understand heterogeneous effects of CGVOs by accountability of village government. The model predicts smaller effects of CGVOs in villages with more accountable governments.  The empirical analysis supports the prediction by showing that the effects of CGVOs on the implementation of land expropriation and one child policy are larger in socially more fragmented villages where governments are less accountable to villagers.</div></font>
