"**Interregional Accessibility and Firm Creation in the Fragmented Economy**", *Job Market Paper* 

[<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/jmp.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>]

<font size="-1">
<p style="text-align: justify"> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Does the reduction in international travel time lower the entry cost for firms, especially those accessing non-local suppliers in the globally fragmented economy? I study this question in the context of recent US-China aviation network expansions, documenting sharp and unevenly distributed travel time reductions between US cities and Chinese prefectures. Employing a novel instrument for travel time constructed from the gradual deregulation of the US-China flight market, I show that the reduction in travel time to China promotes the creation of firms in US cities, more in industries that use many different suppliers. To account for the heterogeneity in supplier presence within China, I estimate a quantitative spatial model featuring sourcing location choice, input-output structure, and a firm entry decision. The model illuminates that the 2004-2013 US-China aviation network expansion increases US firm creation by 1.7%. The heterogeneity in supplier presence across Chinese prefectures drives 42% of the increase because of assortative matching between supplier presence and time reductions in the sparse US-China flight network.</p></font>

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper studies the importance of international lineage network in facilitating the entry of foreign firms into developing country where immature market environment deters foreign investment. We build a unique dataset on the universe of foreign firms in China that are controlled by Chinese diasporas whose surnames are used to infer their lineage groups. A novel triple-difference design exploiting variations from both the staggered opening of prefectures during the Reform Era (1981-1996) and their differential surname distributions is implemented for identification. We find that, following the prefecture-level opening shocks, the entry of diaspora firms with higher connection increase more, because lineage network facilitates information sharing and contract enforcement. On the contrary, there are no such effects following China's accession to WTO because market institutions had been improved much after the Reform Era. We also find that the lineage-driven diaspora firm entrants during early development stages functioned as industrial seeds, in the form of generating large and long-term positive spillovers on non-diaspora firm entry and investment.</p></font>

"**Endogenous Learning, Dynamic Agglomeration, and the Skill Premium over Life Cycle**"

[Preliminary Draft Available Upon Request]

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper proposes a new measure on learning with time use survey data and shows that learning time is lower in big city and higher for high skill workers especially when they are young. This indicates endogenous learning-working tradeoff with skill complementarity. This paper also documents the fact that in 1980-2007 US census data city size wage elasticity firstly diverge and then converge over worker's life cycle. And the fact cannot be explained by existed literature which only considered passive experience accumulation as learning. Therefore the theoretical part of this paper introduces the empirically observed endogenous learning-working tradeoff into dynamic life cycle model nesting experience accumulation and shows that both the divergence and convergence can be accounted for under one unified framework. Furthermore, the model can also match several other novel facts presented in this paper including skill-youngness complementarity in learning time, declining skill premium gap between big and small cities over life cycle, and declining sorting of high skill workers into big city over life cycle.</p></font>
