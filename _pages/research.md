"**Interregional Accessibility and Firm Creation in the Fragmented Economy**", *Job Market Paper* 

[<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/jmp.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]

<font size="-1">
<p style="text-align: justify"> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Does the reduction in international travel time lower the entry cost for firms, especially those accessing non-local suppliers in the globally fragmented economy? I study this question in the context of recent US-China aviation network expansions, documenting sharp and unevenly distributed travel time reductions between US cities and Chinese prefectures. Employing a novel instrument for travel time constructed from the gradual deregulation of the US-China flight market, I show that the reduction in travel time to China promotes the creation of firms in US cities, more in industries that use many different suppliers. To account for the heterogeneity in supplier presence within China, I estimate a quantitative spatial model featuring sourcing location choice, input-output structure, and a firm entry decision. The model illuminates that the 2004-2013 US-China aviation network expansion increases US firm creation by 1.7%. The heterogeneity in supplier presence across Chinese prefectures drives 42% of the increase because of assortative matching between supplier presence and time reductions in the sparse US-China flight network.</p></font>

"**Familiar Strangers: Lineage Connection and Diaspora Direct Investment in China**", with [Fanghao Chen](https://fanghaochen.github.io/homepage/) and [Xiaobo Zhang](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=x.zhang)

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: As a developing country, China became the top destination for foreign direct investment in just a few decades, defying the "Lucas paradox." Using a unique administrative dataset of the universe foreign firms in China, this paper documents that initial foreign direct investment was mainly driven by the Chinese diaspora; massive non-diaspora foreign direct investment did not materialize until a later stage. Leveraging the staggered opening up of Chinese prefectures during 1981-96 as an identification strategy, the paper finds that following the opening up, diaspora direct investment is more likely to enter prefectures with stronger lineage connections. These prefectures also witness a greater number of non-diaspora foreign and domestic private entrants in the later period.</p></font>

"**Endogenous Learning, Dynamic Agglomeration, and the Skill Premium over Life Cycle**"

[*Preliminary Draft Available Upon Request*]

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper proposes a new measure of learning with time use survey data. I show that learning time is lower in big city and higher for high skill workers, especially when they are young. This finding indicates that there is a endogenous learning-working tradeoff with skill-learning complementarity. This paper also documents that in 1980-2007 US census data, city size wage elasticity first diverges and then converges over worker’s life cycle. This fact cannot be explained by existed literature which considers only passive experience accumulation as learning. The theoretical part of this paper therefore introduces the empirically observed endogenous learning-working tradeoff into a dynamic life cycle model nesting the experience accumulation. The model shows that both the divergence and convergence can be accounted for under one unified framework. Furthermore, the model can also match several other novel facts presented in this paper, including the skill-youngness complementarity in learning time, the declining skill premium gap between big and small cities over life cycle, and the declining sorting of high skilled workers into big cities over life cycle.</p></font>

"**Local Connection, Domestic Sourcing, and FDI Performance**", with [Fanghao Chen](https://fanghaochen.github.io/homepage/)

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper estimates the value of surname-based local lineage connections for the performance of firms in China, especially those foreign firms with few alternative local connections. Measuring a firm's local lineage connection by the probability that the legal representative of the firm has ancestry origin in the same prefecture where the firm is located, we use event studies leveraging the firm's legal representative turnovers to identify the value of the local lineage connection to the firm. Furthermore, we find that the values of local lineage connections to domestic firms are lower than to foreign firms that have ethnic Chinese as legal representatives because foreign firms have fewer alternative local connections. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we further check whether foreign firms that get improved local lineage connections, through legal representative turnovers, switch from importing intermediates to sourcing inputs from local suppliers. This ongoing work therefore helps us understand the importance of local connection for FDI performance, from the perspective of building buyer-supplier relationships with domestic firms.</p></font>

"**Brain Gains on the Diaspora Network**", with [Fanghao Chen](https://fanghaochen.github.io/homepage/)

<font size="-1"> 
<p style="text-align: justify"><ins>Abstract</ins>: This paper examines the importance of diaspora networks in promoting brain gains in the context of China's recent industrialization. We measure the technology diffusion between China and other countries by Chinese patents' citation of the patents of other countries and other countries' patent registrations in China. We then identify a higher effect of signing bilateral investment treaties on the technology diffusion between China and countries with larger sizes of Chinese diaspora. Furthermore, we identify patents registered in China with inventors as overseas Chinese and define these patents as diaspora patents. In this way, we can observe the return to China of diaspora inventors from developed countries. We then document the prevalence of diaspora brain gains in terms of returned Chinese inventors from other countries. With the same bilateral investment treaty signing as natural experiments, we show that the Chinese inventors returned from countries with larger sizes of Chinese diaspora are of both greater amount and higher average quality in terms of patent citations.</p></font>
